# dotfiles

This contains custom setup scripts, rcfiles, and other self ref stuffs that
helps me on a day-to-day basis.

You are free to look around, but don't expect anything useful here. On a new
machine, I do this:

``` shell
url -Lo- https://raw.github.com/cbsiddharth/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```
