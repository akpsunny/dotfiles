Sending & Replying To Mail
--------------------------
m - Compose new message
r - Reply to sender only
g - Reply to all ("group")
f - Forward message

Composing Messages
------------------
a - Attach file
A - Attach message - This will allow you to forward a message as an attachment.
    After this command, you will be brought back to the index to select a message.
s - Edit subject field 
t - Edit to: field
p - PGP commands
P - Postpone message. This will save the message into a postponed (think:
    drafts) area for later work. You will be prompted if you want to recall a
    postponed message when you attempt composing a new message.
i - Check spelling - This will invoke ispell, if available on your system.  
q - Abort
D - Detach file
y - Send message
ESC + k - Attach PGP key

Message Status Flags
--------------------
D - Message is deleted (marked for deletion). Actual removal will happen when
    the mailbox is synced, or mutt is exited.
d - Message has attachments marked for deletion. Like message deletion, the
    files are not actually removed until sync or exist.
K - Message contains a PGP public key.
N - Message is new (unread).
O - Message is old.
P - Message is PGP encrypted.
r - Message has been replied to.
S - Message is PGP signed, AND the signature has been verified.
s - Message is PGP signed, but without verification. Verification problems will
    be visible when you open the message.
! - Message is flagged (equivalent to starred in Gmail or red flagged in Outlook).
* - Message is tagged (selected for a multiple-message operation).
+ - Message is addressed to you, and only you.
T - Message is addressed to you, but also others (either in the to or cc lines).
C - Message is CC'ed to you (your address is in the cc line).
F - Message is from you.
L - Message is from a mailing list you're subscribed to.

Handling Messages
-----------------
t - Tag message. Think of tagging as doing a multi-select for a later action,
    such as a move or delete.
T - Tag all messages matching a search pattern
d - Delete message. This will mark the message as deleted, but not immediately
    purge it from the index. This gives you a chance to undelete the message if you
    change your mind.
D - Delete messages matching a pattern. This will mark the messages as deleted,
    but not immediately purge them from the index. This gives you a chance to
    undelete the message if you change your mind. THIS IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS -
    It is recomended you do a limit (L) search to see what your search syntax will
    target, tag them, then delete them (T, enter, ;, d). This command does those
    operations in a single step, and is not recommended unless you are very
    comfortable with the search syntax.
u - Undelete message. Normally the selection bar will skip deleted messages. To
    undelete a message, place the selection bar "above" the message to undelete. Be
    aware that once a message has been removed from the index (either manually, or
    by exiting mutt with a message marked for deletion), the message is permanently
    gone.
; - Apply next command to tagged messages. This requires that you have tagged
    messages using the T or t commands. After keying ;, use another valid message
    handling command to apply that command to all tagged messages.
$ - Synchronize pending actions. If messages are pending deletion, this will
    immediately and irreversibly purge them.

Searching Messages
------------------

l - Limit display to subsequently entered pattern. Run the command again, with
    All or ~A as the pattern to return to the full display.
/ - Search visible display
