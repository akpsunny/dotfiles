On Ubuntu 16.04, open Dash, and go:

Network Connections
1. Add
2. Ethernet
3. Create
4. IPv4 Settings
5. Method: Shared to other computers
6. Set a good name for it
7. Save

Find the IP of the Pi on Ubuntu:

cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases

Then as usual:

ssh pi@IP

Now you can also:

access the Internet from the PI through your Ubuntu's Wifi connection
open a VNC to get rid of the display as well: http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/14611/how-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-without-a-monitor/54393#54393

This is similar to: http://stackoverflow.com/a/35529971/895245 but with several details tweaked and more concise. See also: http://www.interlockroc.org/2012/12/06/raspberry-pi-macgyver/
